# Development Utlitities

My collection of development utitlities that assist
in streamlining my development workflow. This collection
is not finite, and is growing and changing regularly.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - Or you can install via a package manager (i.e. `brew`)

## Installation

- First, be sure to install node.
- Clone the repository.
- `cd <repository path>`
- `npm install`

## Configuration

See the `.shellrc` file, and you can add the functions
as part of your existing shell configuration.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to output the `.shellrc` file to the
`bin/shell` directory. This will produce a fully functional
shell config file that you can use to call `source` on.

## Contributing

Please submit pull requests for review to add your utilities
to the repository.
